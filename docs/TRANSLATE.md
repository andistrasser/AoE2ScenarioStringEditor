# How to translate a scenario

1. Download a campaign of your choice from the in-game Mod Manager or create your own one.
2. Navigate to the Campaign Editor and extract the scenarios (if they are not already extracted) by selecting the
   campaign in the dropdown list and confirming the dialog.
3. You can now find your local scenarios in C:\Users\USER_NAME\Games\Age of Empires 2
   DE\USER_ID\resources\_common\scenario (Windows 10)
4. Open AoE2ScenarioStringEditor.exe
5. Open the scenario you want to translate with File -> Open or by hitting Ctrl+O
6. Once the scenario has been loaded, navigate to the "Raw" tab
7. Copy the content of the textfield and paste it into a translator of your choice (
   e.g. [DeepL Translator](https://www.deepl.com/translator) and/or translate it manually. Note that you have to ensure
   that the line structure will stay the same after translating in order to be able to apply the translated text
   correctly. Also ensure to keep the "\n" symbols or line breaks will be lost after applying.
8. Paste the translated text into the textfield and hit the "Apply" button.
9. You can now check if everything was applied correctly and save the scenario with File -> Save/Save as or by hitting
   the respective shortcuts.
